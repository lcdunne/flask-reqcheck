Flask-Reqcheck
==============

Flask-Reqcheck lets you validate requests in your Flask applications. It uses `Pydantic <https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/>`_ 
models to ensure incoming data meets well-defined schemas, enhancing reliability and security. With a simple decorator you 
can quickly validate request bodies, query parameters, and url path parameters, reducing boilerplate code and minimizing 
errors. Flask-Reqcheck helps you maintain clean and efficient code.
