Flask-Reqcheck
==============

**Flask-Reqcheck** lets you validate requests in your Flask applications. With a simple 
decorator and some `Pydantic <https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/>`_ models, you can quickly 
validate incoming request bodies, query parameters, and url path parameters, reducing 
boilerplate code and minimising errors.

Installation
============

Install it like most others, using ``pip``::

    pip install flask-reqcheck
